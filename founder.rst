On the Founder
==============

Nothing is as easy as it seems, nothing is as difficult as it seems.

If you're not technical
-----------------------

They're basically four options when you're building a technological project that makes possible for it to be created:


#. You're technical enough to build the product 
#. You will learn how to be a technical person if you're not
#. You have money to pay a technical person to do it for you
#. You're best friend is a technical person (and I am not sure about this one enough)   

As a general rule, investors look for companies that doesn't need investors. So shut up, build something, proof there are customers, get traction and when you can't serve all your clients ask for investments. That will assure you better terms and more freedom, because you "know" your business.

You're idea is not as original as you think it is. You have to proof you're right with clients to show validating your idea.


If you're technical
-------------------

If someone offers you a project he wants you to build for them and is not willing to pay you for it because he wants you to be a partner is usually a bad idea. Things get worse if that person calls himself a business person and has no experience to show he actually is.

It's not good idea to be chasing the last technologies, visiting all the meetups that exist and being present in every conference. You won't learn all that stuff together and that's time you can spend building something useful. 

Everybody is great until you work with them, everybody is normal until you know them. Do your research before putting someone on the original team. Things can get messy if you're not looking for the same thing.

Make sure you have clients not that your editor, language, framework, mac or any other stuff is cool.

If you don't have them, get people skill, been educated will take a longer way than knowing bash.

Not been understood is as bad as writting bad PHP, try to speak so people can understand you. 

Humility is a good trait for a cofounder, if the guy is a know it all. Dump him.


Technical and not Technical
---------------------------

Get a mentor, there are guys that can really help you out, learn who they are, approach them, shut up and listen.
Get an accountant, a real one, not a mercenary. You will thank me later.
