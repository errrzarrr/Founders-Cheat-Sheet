If you're not technical
=======================

They're basically four options when you're building a technological project that makes possible for it to be created:
1- You're technical enough to build the product
2- You will learn how to be a technical person if you're not
3- You have money to pay a technical person to do it for you
4- You're best friend is a technical person (and I am not sure about this one enough)

As a general rule, investors look for companies that doesn't need investors. So shut up, build something, proof there are customers, get traction and when you can't serve all your clients ask for investments. That will assure you better terms and more freedom, because you "know" your business.



If you're technical
===================

If someone offers you a project he wants you to build for them and is not willing to pay you for it, because he wants a partner is usually a bad idea. Things get worse if that person calls himself a business person and has no experience to show he actually is.

It's not good idea to be chasing the last technologies, visiting all the meetups that exist and being present in every conference. You won't learn all that stuff together and that's time you can spend building something useful. 

Everybody is great until you work with them, everybody is normal until you know them. Do your research before putting someone on the original team. Things can get messy if you're not looking for the same thing.
